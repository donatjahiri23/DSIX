Because our local organizers told us to submit projects in 4th October, we weren't able to upload the video in the Team page.

Because the application was developed with a simple IDE (jGrasp) we do not guarantee that it will work on other IDE's as well.
Please do not change the names of files as that would make the application unstable.

Our project title is DSIX. It reflects an important aspect of our app which is “discovery”, discovering and getting to new results with data.
DSIX is a user friendly application that offers data analysis and interpretation with datasets reflecting different aspects of earth data ranging from atmosphere data to happiness index.

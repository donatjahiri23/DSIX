Our project title is DSIX. It reflects an important aspect of our app which is “discovery”, discovering and getting to new results with data.
DSIX is a user friendly application that offers data analysis and interpretation with datasets reflecting different aspects of earth data ranging from atmosphere data to happiness index.
